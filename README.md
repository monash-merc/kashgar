The project will develop generic software to support the organisation of pre-existing digital data collections, particularly images, into files and formats suitable for publication via institutional repositories (Fedora), and from those repositories into other discovery services including the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC).

The collection to which the software will be applied in the first instance has been captured as part of the Kashgar Project. This project brings together teams from the Monash Asia Institute and from Urumqi Normal University in Urumqi, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (China) in an international research collaboration to document, measure, and define the most significant cultural monuments and spaces of Kashgar.

This is a Java application. It is developed to run as plugin from Google Picasa. Picasa is free photo editing software from Google. Application also uses Exiftool to extract metadata from images. Exiftool is a platform-independent Perl library plus a command-line application for reading, writing and editing meta information in a wide variety of files.
